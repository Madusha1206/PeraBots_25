**🤖 PerBOTS 25 – Circular Path Navigation Robot**

🏁 Overview

PerBOTS 25 is a robotics simulation project developed for the PerBOTS 2025 competition.
The challenge focused on designing and programming a 2-wheel autonomous robot that can navigate along a circular track, detect and avoid obstacles, and successfully reach the finish line — all within a simulated environment.

💡 Project Description

The simulation models a real-world autonomous navigation task using Python as the core programming language.
The robot utilizes virtual sensors for obstacle detection and dynamic path correction, ensuring continuous movement within the track boundary.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Language: Python
Simulation Tools: Webots
Control Logic: PID-based navigation and collision avoidance
